Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
========================================

The R script called run_analysis.R does the following:

- Read the data in the working directory.
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- Reorders columns to show Subjects and their activities.
- Writes tidy data to a .txt file.
